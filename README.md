# Codex Skills

This directory contains reusable Codex skills—task-specific packages of instructions, resources, and optional scripts that help Codex follow workflows reliably.

## Skills
- `questions/` — Clarify requirements before implementing when a request is underspecified.
- `learn/` — Capture durable corrections or preferences and write them to AGENTS.md.
- `postgres/` — Connect to Postgres databases and run queries or checks.

## Developer Mode
Use `bootstrap.sh` on macOS to create a symlink at `~/Developer/Skills` pointing to this repo for quick access.
