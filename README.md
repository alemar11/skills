# Custom Codex Skills

This directory contains reusable Codex skills. Each skill has a `SKILL.md` entrypoint and may include helper scripts.

## Skills
- `questions/` — Ask clarifying questions when a request is underspecified.
- `learn/` — Capture durable preferences and write them into AGENTS guidance.
- `postgres/` — Postgres connection workflows and helper scripts for local development.

## Developer Mode
Use `bootstrap.sh` on macOS to create a symlink at `~/Developer/Skills` pointing to this repo for quick access.
